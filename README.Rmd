## Installation

You can install the dev version of **{kaggler}** from [CRAN](https://github.com/koderkow/kaggler) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## install kaggler package from github
devtools::install_packages("koderkow/kaggler")
```

# API Authorization

All users must be authenticated to interact with Kaggle‚Äôs APIs. To setup your API key refer to the [Get Started](https://koderkow.github.io/kaggler/articles/kaggler.html) guide.

# Kaggle Flow

This is an **experimental** and **opinionated** reproducible workflow for working with Kaggle competitions.

```r
library(kaggler)

kgl_flow("titanic")

#> ‚Ä¢ These files will be downloaded:
#>   - 'gender_submission'
#>   - 'test'
#>   - 'train'.
#> ‚Ä¢ Downloading 'gender_submission.csv'...
#> ‚Ä¢ Downloading 'test.csv'...
#> ‚Ä¢ Downloading 'train.csv'...
```

For a more in-depth walkthrough visit the [Kaggle Flow](https://koderkow.github.io/kaggler/articles/kgl-flow.html) page.

# Direct API Interaction

These will be functions the user can call to have custom control over the returns and interactions with the API.

## `kgl_competitions_list_.*()`

Browse or search for Kaggle compeitions.

```{r complist}
## look through all competitions (paginated)
comps1 <- kgl_competitions_list()
comps1

## it's paginated, so to see page two:
comps2 <- kgl_competitions_list(page = 2)
comps2

## search by keyword for competitions
imagecomps <- kgl_competitions_list(search = "image")
imagecomps
```

## `kgl_competitions_data_.*()`

You can look up the datalist for a given Kaggle competition using the API. 

```{r}
## data list for a given competition
c1_datalist <- kgl_competitions_data_list(comps1$ref[1])
c1_datalist
```

Downloading single files is possible by supplying the competition ID and the wanted file.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## download set sets (IF YOU HAVE ACCEPTED COMPETITION RULES)
c1_data <- kgl_competitions_data_download(
  id = comps1$ref[1],
  file_name = c1_datalist$name[1]
  )
#> x You must accept this competition's rules before you'll be able to download files.
```

### Downloading all data for a competition
  
#### `kgl_competitions_data_download_all()`

This function will download all the competitions data files into a dir called `_kaggle_data` into the main working directory.

```{r}
kgl_data <- kgl_competitions_data_download_all(
  id = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/"
  )
```

The data is available in the `_kaggle_data` directory.

```{r}
list.files("_kaggle_data")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
fs::dir_delete("_kaggle_data")
```

The data is also returned in a list and available in the variable you assigned it to, in this example its `kgl_data`.

```{r}
kgl_data$train
kgl_data$test
kgl_data$gender_submission
```

## `kgl_datasets_.*()`

Get a list of all of the datasets.

```{r datalist}
## get competitions data list
datasets <- kgl_datasets_list()
datasets
```

## `kgl_competitions_leaderboard_.*()`

View the leaderboard for a given competition.

```{r leaderboard}
## get competitions data list
c1_leaderboard <- kgl_competitions_leaderboard_view(comps1$ref[1])
c1_leaderboard
```


## Note(s)

- The base of this package was cloned from the original at [{kaggler}](https://github.com/mkearney/kaggler). I have decided to take the developers work and continue their amazing development! Major props and recognition goes out to the original developer(s) of this package.
  - I will be updating all documentation and examples for the README and functions for this package as time goes on
- The the developers are in no way affiliated with Kaggle.com, and, as such, makes no assurances that there won't be breaking changes to the API at any time
- Although the developers are not affiliated, it's good practice to be informed, so here is the link to Kaggle's terms of service: https://www.kaggle.com/terms
