## Note(s)

- The base of this package was cloned from the original at [{kaggler}](https://github.com/mkearney/kaggler). I have decided to take the developers work and continue their amazing development! Major props and recognition goes out to the original developer(s) of this package.
  - I will be updating all documentation and examples for the README and functions for this package as time goes on
- The the developers are in no way affiliated with Kaggle.com, and, as such, makes no assurances that there won't be breaking changes to the API at any time
- Although the developers are not affiliated, it's good practice to be informed, so here is the link to Kaggle's terms of service: https://www.kaggle.com/terms
